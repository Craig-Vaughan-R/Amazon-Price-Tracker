This Python project tracks the price of an electric standing desk on Amazon UK. It periodically scrapes the price from the product page, stores it in a CSV file along with a timestamp indicating when the data was collected.

## Features
- Automatic price tracking: The script checks the price of the standing desk every 12 hours and updates the CSV file.
- Data storage: Prices along with the corresponding product title and collection date are stored in a CSV file for easy reference and analysis.
